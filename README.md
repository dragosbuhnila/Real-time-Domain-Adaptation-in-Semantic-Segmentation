# Real-time-Domain-Adaptation-in-Semantic-Segmentation
Final Project for the 24/25 Advanced Machine Learning course @PoliTO. The topic is working with semantic segmentation networks, with a focus on PIDNet, using the LoveDA chinese satellite images dataset, and try to bridge the gap between Urban and Rural domains through DA methods AdaptSegNet and DACS.

The project has been developed by Buhnila Dragos-Constantin, Jhad Kharrat, and Gigante Fabio.  

Although the results are not desirable, we belive that the work done may give insight towards the possible issues that caused such outcome.
